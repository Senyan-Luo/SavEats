Our project combines the Yelp, Groupon and zipcode APIs to allow an end-user to be able to identify food discounts in their area along with yelp ratings, avg cost and a map link through google's map API (but since we're just giving the EU a google map link, we don't count that one.)

The time to grab the groupon discounts and then the associated yelp information could be a little long so we also developed a version that uses a firebase cache to prepopulate the yelp info around the groupon discount codes and then grab the yelp info based upon a groupon pull.


The front-end uses high-resolution graphics and bootstrap for a full desktop experience.


Per Joeyâ€™s suggestion, we used cors-anywhere to work around current browser single-origin security rules.
